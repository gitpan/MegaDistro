None that I can think of at the moment;
  Just lots of improvements, that would not prevent the release of the system. :)


---- Improvements ----

Use File::Spec, where using commands `mkdir -p`,
  as well as, `rm -rf`.


Use Archive::Tar over, requiring another dependency,
  being the `tar` command.

Make tests (in general), more portable,
  unless they are to be used specifically for versionchecking

Lexically improve the code, formatting,
  i.e. run perltidy (on all code)  ;)
       (tabs bad!)
  
  Additionally, just "clean_up_the_code", as I go along (obviously). - Dave.
        - particularly, the unique use of "Dave\'s " . "\quoting"; ;)
          (e.g. ----------------->  printf "%15s", '[  ' . "Success!" . '  ]' . "\n"; 
              could be written as:  printf "%15s[  Success!  ]\n"; )   - Schwern

  *very very* minor, but fix formatting for main output (while preserving the API) - i.e. install rtypes, etc.
          - Dave.
          

*Make a "MegaDistro" object and have the Configure script use that to
  setup the configuration, and start the actions. [old]
        -perhaps handle debate this later, for another release, 
          since reworking the code base at this point, is not a viable option.

Extend the Module list, to the YAML (standard) convention, such that it will have available options, 
  whether they pertain to the building/testing -of the modules.

  However, it's unknown to me, at the moment, whether this could be used, in the future,
    to settle/work-around external dependency problems (dependencies), introduced by a given module
      (e.g. DBD::mysql, GD, Net::SSLeay)

Write my own, sort of, "dummy modules," to be shipped with the megadistro module, such that, 
  the packaging/build tests won't have to "cheat," as they currently do (use of --force option).
