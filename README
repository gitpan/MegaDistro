# MegaDistro - README file #
#--------------------------#

INTRODUCTION: MegaDistro, is a system by which a list of perl modules can be built, 
                into the form a binary package (rpm or deb).

REQUIREMENTS: CPANPLUS-0.0562 or greater *must be configured*
              Module-CoreList-2.02 or greater
              ExtUtils-MakeMaker-6.17 or greater
              Archive::Tar
              File::Spec

USAGE: The usage of the system is briefly described as follows.

The perl MegaDistro system is used to create packages of perl modules, simply by reading a list.

For example, all that is required, is that you simply write a list of modules, 
  (See modules.list), or (t/test.list - in the src directory), for an example of this.

Hence, the first thing that you must do, is create the module list.
  - The default location of the module list is: ~/.megadistro/modules.list
    (Note: you may create and use a list with another name, or, in another location,
           however, you must specify this, upon execution of the program, see below).

However, you must note the following things:

       o) Module dependencies, by default, will not settled automatically.
            Therefore, to ensure that all prerequesites for a given module, 
            are installed into the package [to be created], you must specify
            them in the list (currently, order is irrelevant).

       o) Modules that have _external_ dependencies, that is,
          modules which require some sort of external package or program to be installed,
          or require something to be installed in a particular location,
           - are not currently supported.
            (e.g. DBD::mysql, GD, Net::SSLeay)
            

Other than the aforementioned items, the system should, ideally, be a breeze.
  In that, turning your "wish-list" of modules into a binary package,
  should be, no more difficult that simply running the 'megadistro' script, 
  and specifying information, if/as necessary. ;)

Once you've created your module list, you are ready to run it through the system.
  (Note: If you are using a module list other than the default [module.list], 
         you must specify this, by using the --modlist=LIST override,
           where LIST is the /path/to/your/module.list file).
  
  The following are examples of how to run the system:
  
    You may run the system without any options (provided you do not want to override any of the defaults),
    
    To run by default:         megadistro
    	* This method is fine, it will simply ask you which package type you would like to generate :)
    	
    Otherwise, to explicitly specify which type you would like, you may use any of the following:
  
        To generate a rpm:         megadistro -t rpm
    
        To generate a deb:         megadistro -t deb
    
        To generate a tarball:     megadistro --build-only
    
    If you didn't use the default list file [location]:
    
           megadistro --modlist=/new/location/to/my_modules.list

*** For more information regarding command-line options,
        either run: megadistro --help
        or check the documentation: perldoc megadistro

If everything went well, and a package was created, it will be located in: ~/.megadistro


BUGS: If you notice any strange behavior, such as something noticably just doesn't work right,
         or the system blatantly explodes, so to speak - please report them - thanks.
         
More information can be found in the MegaDistro documentation - and remember, this is only experimental, so far. :)
